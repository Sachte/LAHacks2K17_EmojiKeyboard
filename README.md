Ever thought it takes too long to scroll through those long lists of emojis to find the right one? Or do you ever feel like you want to convey an emotion but do not know exactly which emoji to use? Or do you just want a fun, new way to communicate? If so, welcome to EasyEmoji!

We created a custom android keyboard, that has a special key that links to a camera. Using the Face Api and Emotion Api provided by Microsoft Cognitive Services, the keyboard places the emoji wherever the cursor is that best approximates the user's current facial expression.

Android Link: coming soon!
